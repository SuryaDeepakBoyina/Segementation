# DeepLab v3-based Segmentation Model

This repository contains a deep learning-based segmentation model built using DeepLab v3, a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation framework. The model is designed to accurately segment objects in images, making it suitable for tasks like medical imaging, scene understanding, and autonomous navigation.

## Features

- **DeepLab v3 Framework**: Implements DeepLab v3 architecture with atrous convolution for enhanced spatial context.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Supports training and evaluation on custom datasets.
- **Pretrained Backbone**: Leverages pretrained backbones (ResNet, MobileNet) for better performance.
- **Flexible Training Pipeline**: Easy to modify hyperparameters and training configurations.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union) and pixel accuracy.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-enabled GPU (Optional but recommended for faster training)

### Libraries

Install the required libraries by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key dependencies:
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy
- tqdm

## Dataset Preparation

1. Organize your dataset in the following structure:
   ```
   dataset/
   |-- train/
   |   |-- images/
   |   |-- masks/
   |-- val/
   |   |-- images/
   |   |-- masks/
   ```
   - `images/` should contain input images.
   - `masks/` should contain ground truth segmentation masks.

2. Preprocess images and masks as needed, ensuring consistent dimensions.

## Usage

### Training

To train the model, use the following command:
```bash
python train.py --data_dir dataset/ --output_dir output/ --epochs 50 --batch_size 16 --lr 0.001
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model on the validation set, run:
```bash
python evaluate.py --data_dir dataset/ --model_path output/best_model.pth
```

### Inference

For inference on new images:
```bash
python infer.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg --model_path output/best_model.pth --output_path path/to/output.png
```

## Model Configuration

The model architecture and training configurations can be customized through:
- `config.py`: Adjusts model parameters, training settings, and data paths.
- Command-line arguments: Overrides configurations during runtime.

## Results

### Metrics

- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**: Measures overlap between predicted and ground truth masks.
- **Pixel Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correctly classified pixels.

### Visualization

Visualize results using:
```bash
python visualize.py --data_dir dataset/ --model_path output/best_model.pth
```
